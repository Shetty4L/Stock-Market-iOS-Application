# Stock Market iOS Application
An iOS application that provides real-time stock market information for all companies registered with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. This application uses the same NodeJS backend as [Stock-Market-Application](https://github.com/Shetty4L/Stock-Market-Application) and is essentially its iOS port.

## Prerequisites
You will need XCode and essentially open this project in XCode to play around with it. This application was the final project for my CSCI 571 course at USC and hence, all naming patterns involve 'HW9' in them.
